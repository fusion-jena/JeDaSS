Abstract. One  of  the  added  values  of  long  running  and  large  scalecollaborative projects is the ability to answer complex research questionsbased on the extensive use of collected data. In practice, however, findingand identifying related data in the central repository of these projectsoften proves to be a demanding task. In this paper, we aim to release datafrom silos, thereby enabling cross-cutting analyses that were earlier out ofreach. To achieve that we introduce a new data summarization//alsayed:(analysis)//and profiling approach exploiting the semantics of annotateddatasets  using  a  domain  specific  ontology.  In  particular,  the  proposedapproach makes use of the capability of machine learning to categorizea give dataset into a domain topic and to extract hidden links across itsdata  attributes  and  other  data  attributes  from  different  datasets.  Theproposed approach has been developed and has been applied to datasetscollected in the CRC AquaDiva.
