 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, ENVO:water is to be understood as environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water. This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000111 , environmental material

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.  Soil taxonomy, 2nd Ed., quoted in http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. ,
 Everything under this parent must be a mass noun. All subclasses are to be understood as being composed primarily of the named entity, rather than restricted to that entity. For example, ENVO:water is to be understood as environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water. This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A portion of environmental material is a fiat object which forms the medium or part of the medium of an environmental system.  
 This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of uppermost may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010504 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A surface layer is the uppermost layer of some material entity.     
 surface layer , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010504 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A surface layer is the uppermost layer of some material entity. 
 oceanic sea surface microlayer biome , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000034 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , The oceanic sea surface microlayer (SML) biome comprises the top 1000 micrometers of the marine surface waters occurring offshore, away from a continental shelf. It is the boundary layer where all exchange occurs between the atmosphere and the ocean. The chemical, physical, and biological properties of the SML differ greatly from the sub-surface water just a few centimeters beneath.  
 neritic sea surface microlayer biome , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000041 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , The neritic sea surface microlayer (SML) biome comprises the top 1000 micrometers of marine surface waters occurring above a continental shelf. It is the boundary layer where all exchange occurs between the atmosphere and the ocean. The chemical, physical, and biological properties of the SML differ greatly from the sub-surface water just a few centimeters beneath.  ,
 marine surface current , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000099 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances.  ,
 ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.  ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , Ecozones delineate large areas of the Earths surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as oceans, broad deserts, or high mountain ranges, that constitute barriers to migration.  
 This is kept as a general class. One can specify subclasses by identifying the protruding material (e.g. rock outcroup, mineral outcrop, etc ) and the material(s) the protrusion emerges from. Possible logical definition:   A portion of ENVO:environmental material which has_quality PATO:protruding out of a ENVO:surface layer of an ENVO:environmental material. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000302 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A portion of environmental material which protrudes through a surface layer.  ,
 The DCM may or may not indicate greater abundance of photosynthetic, chlorophyll-bearing cells, as shade-adapted cells may have a greater chlorophyll to biomass ration than surface variants. Further, some DCMs may be formed by the sinking of cells from surface zones or the subduction of surface waters, rather than through biotic, community-level processess. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000326 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A subsurface layer in a water body, typically an ocean or lake, in which chlorophyll concentrations reach their maximum.

 Not recommended for annotation. This class is likely to be made into an inferred class as its subclasses are distributed among more meaningful superclasses (i.e. ceiling is_a surface layer). See for example, building floor. The boundaries between building parts may be bona fide or fiat. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000420 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A building part is a construction which is part of a building.   
 The logical definitions must state which social and leisure activities are included here. Jet-skiing and mass rallies are probably not the range. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000423 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A living room is a room in a human house which is used for social and domestic leisure activities. 
 This could be moved to surface layer like other floors, although more thought has to be given to floor: a role of a surface layer?  ,
The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_latrine , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000520 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A latrine slab is a  broad, flat, thick piece of solid material (typically stone or concrete) used as the floor of a latrine and which includes a hole through which excreta are deposited into a latrine pit.  ,
 This is distinct from natural gas which is a fossil fuel product. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000556 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , Biogas is a mixture of different gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen,  is primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide, and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, water, and siloxanes.

 Of interest for future development: Some causes of mass wasting earthquakes, increased overburden from structures, increased soil moisture, reduction of roots holding the soil to bedrock, undercutting of the slope by excavation or erosion, weathering by frost heave, bioturbation, volcanic edifice over-steepening. Some processes that reduce mass wasting: Afforestation, Reforestation, Terracing steps on slopes (reduce angle of slope). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_wasting. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000690 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , Mass wasting is the geomorphic process by which solid environmental material such as soil, sand, regolith, and/or rock move downslope typically as a mass, largely under the force of gravity, but frequently affected by water and water content as in submarine environments and mudslides.

 mass wasting flow , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000696 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A mass wasting flow is a form of mass wasting during which the moving materials behave similarly to a flowing fluid. Water, air and ice are often involved in enabling fluidlike motion of the material.   
 Mudflows are often called mudslides, a term applied indiscriminately by the mass media to a variety of mass wasting events. Mudflows often start as slides, becoming flows as water is entrained along the flow path; such events are often called flow slides. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflow , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000697 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A mudflow is a form of mass wasting which involves very rapid to extremely rapid surging flow of debris that has become partially or fully liquified by the addition of significant amounts of water to clay-rich source material.  ,

 liquid chromatography valve , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000528 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.

 chromatography splitter , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000619 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115 , An adjustable restriction that is placed in the waste outlet to allow the necessary pressure to develop at the column inlet to force a flow (q ml/min) through the column. If the flow of mobile phase is Q ml/min then the waste flow will be (Q-q) ml/min. by adjusting the waste flow, the proportion of the sample entering the capillary column can be varied over a wide range of values and the necessary minimum permissible volume for the particular column in use can be selected for analysis. Unfortunately, the fraction taken in this way may not be representative of the original sample. This is due to the individual solutes in the mixture having different diffusivities and, thus, they distribute themselves across the sampling tube in an irregular manner. In general, the components with higher diffusivities (e.g., those solutes of lower molecular weight) will diffuse away from the bulk sample more quickly than those having lower diffusivities.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.  Soil taxonomy, 2nd Ed., quoted in http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000116 , The various has part and has quality relations may not hold true for all soils; however, I have yet to find counter examples. Require input from a pedologist or similar. [pbuttigieg] 
 The DCM may or may not indicate greater abundance of photosynthetic, chlorophyll-bearing cells, as shade-adapted cells may have a greater chlorophyll to biomass ration than surface variants. Further, some DCMs may be formed by the sinking of cells from surface zones or the subduction of surface waters, rather than through biotic, community-level processess. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000326 , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000116 , Logical def is incomplete. Need to express the idea of maximum chlorophyll. This could follow a pattern like: 
   
X has_maximum_levels_of Y relative_to Z, i.e. DCM has_maximum_levels_of chlorophyll relative_to  subsurface_aquatic_layer  ,
   
May also be useful to include has_decreased_levels_of light intensity relative_to surface aquatic layer

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.  ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280 , http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#creation_date , 2013-10-13T18:32:46Z

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280 , http://www.geneontology.org/formats/oboInOwl#hasOBONamespace , ENVO

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280 , http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type , http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of uppermost may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000105 , http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010504

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

For example, ENVO:water is to be understood as environmental material composed primarly of some CHEBI:water. This class is currently being aligned to the Basic Formal Ontology. Following this alignment, its definition and the definitions of its subclasses will be revised. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000194 , http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483

 This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of uppermost may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000501 , http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010504

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity.

 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time.

Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue.

Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280 , http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf , b89

 This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of uppermost may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here. , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000862 , http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010504

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of uppermost may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , b191 , http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#annotatedSource , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,
   
The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,

For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.

 In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the solid geology. Soil is commonly referred to as earth or dirt; technically, the term dirt should be restricted to displaced soil. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil  ,
   
 The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.  ,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories. , b324 , http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#someValuesFrom , http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000280
