indeterminate root nodule nitrogen fixation zone,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000171,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115,"A part of an indeterminate root nodule where each cell contains a large, central vacuole and the cytoplasm is filled with fully differentiated bacteroids which are actively fixing nitrogen. Typically, the plant provides these cells with leghemoglobin, resulting in a distinct pink color."
